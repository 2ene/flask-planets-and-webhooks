	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// planetCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	planetCmd.Flags().IntVarP(&Position, "position", "p", 0, "Position of planet to select")
